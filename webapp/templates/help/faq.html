<p id="intro">
Hello. My name is Sean and I'm the owner of Lookout. I hope this FAQ answers
whatever questions you have. If you feel something is missing or have
any other questions please send me an email directly. <span class="underline">My email is sean@twosix.es.</span>
</p>
<ul id="questions">
  <li>
  <h4>Can I just email you my question?</h4>
  <p>Of course. <span class="underline">My email is sean@twosix.es.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h4>I forgot my password.</h4>
  <p>
  No problem. You want to go <a href="{% url django.contrib.auth.views.password_reset %}">here.</a>
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h4>Lookout flagged a very important alert as irrelevant.</h4>
  <p>Well, this is not good news at all. Please send me an email
  (sean@twosix.es) and I'll look into it right away. I promise
  to do 10 pushups any time an alert is falsely flagged as
  irrelevant. It's very important to us that Lookout's filter works
  perfectly, so please tell us when it doesn't work.
  </li>
  <li>
  <h4>I'm getting rubbish alerts in my feed. It's not working!</h4>
  <p>Yarg. That's not good. Please send me an email from your
  account's email address and tell me which client is getting all the
  irrelevant alerts and I'll see about fixing it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h4>How do I edit a search term once I've created one?</h4>
  <p>The easiest thing to do is create a new search term with the text
  you want and delete the old one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h4>What is the thumbs down button next to my links for?</h4>
  <p>Whenever you get an alert that is rubbish, click on the thumbs
  down button next to it. This tells the filter to mark future alerts
  that look like this one as irrelevant. The more you click thumbs
  down, the more relevant your alerts will be.
  </li>
</ul>
