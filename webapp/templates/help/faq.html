  <p id="intro">
  Hello. Feel free to peruse this FAQ, but we love hearing from our
  customers. Please send us
  an email with your question or fill out <a href="{% url contact %}">this form</a>. <span class="underline">Our email is help@twosix.es.</span>
  </p>
  <ul id="questions">
    <li>
    <h4>Can I just email you my question?</h4>
    <p>Of course. <span class="underline">Send an email to help@twosix.es.</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h4>I forgot my password.</h4>
    <p>
    No problem. You want to go <a href="{% url django.contrib.auth.views.password_reset %}">here.</a>
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h4>How do I edit a search term once I've created one?</h4>
    <p>The easiest thing to do is create a new search term with the text
    you want and delete the old one.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h4>What is the thumbs down button next to my links for?</h4>
    <p>Whenever you get an alert that is junk, click on the thumbs
    down button next to it. This tells the filter to mark future alerts
    that look like this one as irrelevant. The more you click thumbs
    down, the more relevant your alerts will be.
    </li>
    <li>
    <h4>Lookout flagged a very important alert as irrelevant.</h4>
    <p>Well, this is not good news at all. Send us an email or use this
    form. Be sure to include the URL of the alert that was irrelevant,
    (or just copy/paste the text of the alert, we'll figure it out),
    and the name of the client.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h4>I'm getting rubbish alerts in my feed. It's not working!</h4>
    <p>Yarg. That's not good. Please send us an email from your
    account's email address and include which client is getting all the
    irrelevant alerts and we'll see if we can whip things into shape.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h4>How do I contact you?</h4>
    <p>The best way to contact us is to email us at help@twosix.es. Or
  you can <a href="{% url contact %}">use this form</a>. You can also
  email the owner directly at sean@twosix.es. And you can follow us on
  Twitter, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/twosixesllc">@twosixesllc</a></p>
